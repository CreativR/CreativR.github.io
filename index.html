        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a country located in Central Africa. It is the second-largest country in Africa by area, after Algeria. The DRC is bordered by nine countries: Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia. The capital and largest city is Kinshasa. The DRC gained independence from Belgium in 1960. At the time of independence, the country was named the Republic of the Congo-Léopoldville to distinguish it from its neighbor the Republic of the Congo-Brazzaville. With the promulgation of the Luluabourg Constitution on 1 August 1964, the country became the DRC but was renamed Zaire (a past name for the Congo River) on 27 October 1971 by President Mobutu Sese Seko as part of his Authenticité initiative. The word Zaire is from a Portuguese adaptation of a Kikongo word nzadi ("river"), a truncation of nzadi o nzere ("river swallowing rivers").In 1992, the Sovereign National Conference voted to change the name of the country back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but the change was not made. The country's name was later restored by President Laurent-Désiré Kabila when he overthrew Mobutu in 1997.The DRC is a country with a rich history and culture. It is home to many different ethnic groups, each with its own unique language and customs. The DRC is also a country with a lot of natural resources, including diamonds, copper, cobalt, and timber. However, the DRC is also a country that has been plagued by conflict and instability. The country has been involved in several civil wars since independence, and it is currently facing a humanitarian crisis.The name change of the DRC is a reflection of the country's turbulent history. The name Zaire was chosen by Mobutu as part of his attempt to create a new national identity for the country. However, the name was unpopular with many Congolese people, who felt that it was a way for Mobutu to consolidate his power. The restoration of the name Democratic Republic of the Congo was seen as a way to move away from the authoritarian rule of Mobutu and to embrace a more democratic future.The DRC is a country with a lot of potential. It is a resource-rich country with a rich history and culture. However, the country needs to overcome its history of conflict and instability in order to achieve its full potential.</p>

    <h2>Terrain</h2>
    <p>The terrain of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is as diverse as its people. The country is home to a wide range of landscapes, from the tropical rainforests of the Congo River basin to the snow-capped peaks of the Ruwenzori Mountains.The central part of the country is dominated by the Congo River basin, which is a vast, low-lying area covered by rainforest. The rainforest is home to a wide variety of plants and animals, including some of the world's most endangered species.To the east of the Congo River basin is the Albertine Rift, a series of mountains that form part of the East African Rift System. The Albertine Rift is home to several volcanoes, including Mount Nyiragongo, one of the world's most active volcanoes.To the west of the Congo River basin is the Western Congolian Plateau, a region of rolling hills and savannas. The plateau is home to a variety of wildlife, including elephants, giraffes, and lions.The southern part of the DRC is home to the Katanga Province, which is known for its copper and cobalt mines. The province is also home to the Upemba Depression, a large, marshy area that is home to a variety of birds and animals.The northern part of the DRC is home to the Orientale Province, which is known for its rainforests and savannas. The province is also home to the Virunga Mountains, which are home to the world's last remaining mountain gorillas.The DRC is a country with a rich and diverse terrain. The country's varied landscape is home to a wide variety of plants and animals, and it is a major source of natural resources. However, the country's terrain has also been a factor in its history of conflict and instability. The dense rainforests and rugged mountains have made it difficult to control the country's borders, and they have also provided a safe haven for rebel groups.Despite the challenges, the DRC is a country with a bright future. The country's natural resources could help to boost its economy, and its diverse terrain could make it a popular tourist destination. The DRC is a country with a lot of potential, and it is important to remember that its terrain is just one part of its story.</p>

    <section id="history">
        <h2> History</h2>
        <p>The ancient history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is long and complex. The earliest known human settlements in the region date back to the Middle Stone Age, approximately 90,000 years ago. The first real states, such as the Kongo, the Lunda, the Luba and Kuba, appeared south of the equatorial forest on the savannah from the 14th century onwards.The Kingdom of Kongo was the most powerful state in the region in the 15th and 16th centuries. It controlled much of western and central Africa, including what is now the western portion of the DR Congo. The kingdom was a major trading power, and its capital, Mbanza Kongo, was a wealthy and cosmopolitan city.The Kingdom of Kongo declined in the 17th century, due to a combination of factors, including internal conflict and Portuguese colonization. However, other states, such as the Lunda and the Luba, continued to thrive.The DRC was not a single, unified state until the late 19th century. In 1885, King Leopold II of Belgium established the Congo Free State, a private colony that he ruled as his own personal property. The Congo Free State was a brutal regime, and its exploitation of the Congolese people led to widespread suffering.In 1908, the Congo Free State was transferred to the Belgian government. The Belgian Congo was a colonial state, but it was less brutal than the Congo Free State. However, the Congolese people still suffered under Belgian rule.
            The DRC gained independence from Belgium in 1960. The country has been plagued by conflict and instability ever since. The most recent civil war, which lasted from 1998 to 2003, was one of the deadliest conflicts in recent history.The DRC is a country with a rich and complex history. The ancient history of the region is long and fascinating, and the DRC has played an important role in the development of Africa. The country is currently facing many challenges, but it also has a lot of potential. The DRC is a country with a bright future, and it is important to remember its rich history as it moves forward.

Patrice Lumumba wins Congo's first elections and becomes the coalition government's prime minister. He attempts to steer a neutral course between the United States and the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War.
        
        <h5>1960:</h5> A secessionist movement launched in eastern Katanga province is supported by the Belgians in an attempt to garner off the rich copper belt from the Congo state.

        <h5>1971 :</h5> Mobutu changes his name to Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu wa Za Banga (which translates as: The all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake) and renames the country Zaire. He gains unquestioned support from the US government by siding with the US during the Cold War and allowing his country to be used as a springboard for operations against Soviet-backed Angola.  He receives substantial US financial assistance.
        
        <h5>1974:</h5> American boxers Muhammad Ali and George Foreman fight the "rumble in the jungle" in Zaire. Ali, who wins the fight, says he wanted to establish a relationship between African-Americans and Africa.
        
        <h5>1991:</h5> With the cold war over, the US government finds its alliance with authoritarian Mobutu embarrassing. Mobutu is forced to open up the country to multiparty democracy and permits a National Sovereign Conference to discuss the transition. For some 15 months, the country's political leadership discusses the political, economic and social situation. Following the conference, Mobutu appoints a transitional government but remains president and holds on to substantial powers.
        War
        <h5>April 1994:</h5> Rwanda's Hutu extremist government orchestrates a genocide of some 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu.

Tens of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees flee westwards into Zaire's forests pursued by Rwandan army soldiers. 
        
        <h5>May 1997:</h5> Mobutu flees into exile. With minimal resistance, the AFDL rebels and the Rwandan army seize Kinshasa, and Laurent Kabila, the rebel leader, is installed as president. The country is renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo.

        <h5>September 1997 : </h5>The UN attempts to follow-up on the fate of the Rwandan Hutu refugees missing in the forests of Zaire and to investigate reports of their mass slaughter by AFDL rebels and Rwandan army soldiers, but are blocked by the new Congolese government. Subsequent UN attempts to investigate are also thwarted.
        
        <h5>Late 1997:</h5> Members of the former Rwandan Hutu extremist government establish a new armed group called the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda (ALIR) with members inside and outside Congo.

It calls for further investigations at a more "opportune" time.
        
        <h5>August 1998:</h5> President Laurent Kabila demands that his Rwandan army backers leave the country. Kabila purges Tutsi from his government and whips up anti-Tutsi sentiment in an attempt to show his independence from Rwanda. Less than a week later, Rwandan and Ugandan armies invade Congo, backing a hastily formed Congolese rebel group seeking to oust Kabila.
        
        <h5>August 1998: </h5> President Kabila receives support from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola and repels an attempt by the Rwandan and Ugandan armies to take Kinshasa, though they and their allied rebel groups remain in control of large parts of eastern Congo.

        Failed Peace Efforts
        <h5>August 1999:</h5> After a year of fighting involving the armies of seven other African countries, and a host of rebel groups, a ceasefire agreement is signed in Lusaka, Zambia.  The Lusaka agreement fails to halt the fighting.

The top Rwandan officer involved in the battle, Karenzi Karake, is later appointed deputy commander of the UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur.
        
        <h5>June 2000:</h5> The International Rescue Committee in the first mortality survey conducted in Congo reports that more than 1.7 million people have died in the east of the country since 1998 due to the war.
        
        <h5>January 2001:</h5> President Laurent Kabila is assassinated by a bodyguard. After days of uncertainty, his 29-year-old son Joseph takes office.

        <h5>April 2001:</h5> The UN panel of experts on illegal exploitation publishes its first detailed report concluding that the Congo war has evolved into a conflict for access and control over minerals. It recommends sanctions against top military officials and companies involved in the illegal trade. No action is taken.  The UN calls for further investigations.
        
        <h5>May 2001:</h5> In an updated mortality survey, the International Rescue Committee finds the total death toll in Congo has increased to 2.5 million with huge losses among children.
        
        <h5>January 2002:</h5> Mount Nyiragongo, a volcano overlooking the eastern town of Goma, erupts, devastating large swathes of the city and sending its 300,000 residents across the border into Rwanda to escape lava flows. Unwilling to stay in Rwanda, Goma's residents return within days.
        
        <h5>February 2002:</h5> The Inter-Congolese dialogue begins between rebel factions and other political actors in Sun City, South Africa, to hammer out a peace deal. After 52 days, two of the main rebels groups sign an agreement, but the Rwandan-backed rebels are excluded.
        
        <h5>February 2002:</h5> Following a Belgium parliamentary inquiry, the Belgium government apologizes to Congo for the role played by its officials in the assassination of Lumumba.

        <h5>September 2002:</h5> An estimated 3,000 civilians are brutally massacred when rival militias clash in the hospital town of Nyankunde, Ituri district. The event marks the largest massacre of the second Congo war. Only one international newspaper reports it.
        
        <h5>October 2002:</h5> Rwanda pulls its 20,000 troops out of Congo following pressure from the international community and a loose agreement from the Congolese government to disarm the Rwandan Hutu rebels, some of whose leaders participated in the genocide. The UN Security Council authorizes an increase in peacekeeping troops to 8,600.
        
        <h5>October 2002: </h5>The UN panel of experts on illegal exploitation publishes another report concluding the withdrawal of foreign troops is unlikely to curb the plunder of Congo's mineral wealth since "elite criminal networks" have been established to carry on the exploitation. The panel lists 85 international companies that violated international business norms in Congo.
        
        <h5>December 2002:</h5> South Africa brokers a peace deal with the Rwandan-backed rebels paving the way for a Congolese transitional government where the rebels and the government agree to share power. The deal stipulates that Kabila remains interim president but shares power with four vice-presidents, two of whom are former rebel leaders.
        
        <h5>April 2003:</h5> Based on its latest mortality survey, the International Rescue Committee reports that the death toll of Congolese civilians since 1998 has risen to 3.3 million, the largest civilian death toll of any war since World War II.
        
        <h5>May 2003:</h5> Following immense diplomatic pressure, Uganda is the last foreign government to withdraw its troops from Congo. Having armed local ethnic militias in the northeast of the country, the Ugandan withdrawal creates a power vacuum and unleashes a wave of inter-ethnic fighting in the Ituri district that results in the deaths of thousands more civilians.
        
        <h5>June 2003:</h5> At the request of the UN, European troops, largely made up of French soldiers, are urgently deployed to Ituri to protect civilians caught in brutal fighting between rival ethnic militias following Uganda's withdrawal and to support the beleaguered UN peacekeepers hunkered down in their small base in the town of Bunia.
        
        <h5>July 2003:</h5> Human Rights Watch publishes a report "Ituri: Covered in Blood" detailing the widespread "ethnic cleansing" and human rights abuses taking place in Ituri district.
        
        <h5>July 2003:</h5> The UN Security Council finally strengthens MONUC's mandate to permit the use of force to protect civilians at risk and authorizes an increase in peacekeeping troops to 10,800. Three months after their arrival, the EU force in Bunia is replaced by UN troops.
        
        
        
        <h4>Transition</h4>
        <h5>July 2003:</h5> The transitional government is sworn in with Joseph Kabila as interim president. Democratic elections are scheduled to be held within two years. Fighting continues in the east.   
        
        <h5>October 2003:</h5>  The UN panel on illegal exploitation publishes its final report concluding that the plunder of Congo's mineral wealth is likely to continue to fuel conflict and cause immense human suffering if national and international measures to curb it are not put in place.

        <h5>August 2004:</h5> 160 Congolese Tutsi in a refugee camp in Gatumba, Burundi, are massacred by Burundian Hutu guerillas, possibly aided by other armed groups.  Congolese Vice-President Azarias Ruberwa, a Tutsi and leader of the former Rwandan-backed rebel groups, suspends his participation in the transitional government, nearly causing the peace process to unravel.  He later returns after diplomatic pressure.
        
        <h5>October 2004:</h5> The UN Security Council authorizes an additional 5,900 troops for MONUC bringing the total number of peacekeepers to 16,431. The figure is only half of what the UN secretary-general had requested a few months earlier.
        
        <h5>December 2004:</h5> The death toll climbs to 3.9 million dead, according to the International Rescue Committee in its fourth mortality survey. The majority of the deaths are due to lack of access to medicine or malnutrition.
        
        <h5>January 2005</h5>    
        The transitional government appoints five former Ituri warlords with brutal records of human rights abuses as generals in the army. Human rights groups express outrage.

        Human Rights Watch publishes "The Curse of Gold," a report detailing the widespread human rights abuses linked to ruthless efforts by armed groups and multinational companies to control and profit from gold mining areas in northeastern Congo. A Swiss company buying gold from Congo, criticized in the report, immediately announces it will halt its purchases.
        
        <h5>June 2005</h5>
        
        A Congolese parliamentary commission led by parliamentarian Christophe Lutundula submits a report which finds that dozens of mining contracts struck during the war years are either illegal or provide no benefit for the state. It recommends judicial action against senior political and corporate actors. Copies of the report for distribution to parliament go missing.
        
        <h5>July 2005</h5>
